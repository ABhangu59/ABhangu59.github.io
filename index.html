        <p>Here is some more information about me!:
          <h3>Why Computer Science?</h3>
          <ul>
              <li> I chose computer science because of my older sister, who pursued Computer Science at another post-secondary institute, 
                I would always see the work she was doing and find it intriguing. It was once I started developing myself in highschool that
                I found out that I thoroughly enjoy the feeling of creating something from nothing but abstract ideas. The field of Computer Science also has one of the 
                best outlook out of any fields and it allows me to mix in my hobbies, such as finance, with my career!
              </li>
          
          </ul>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <ul>
              <li>Programming Languages: Java, Python, SQLite, and I've started working on these languages too: SQL, GoLang, Scheme</li>
              <li>Excellent Time Management and Communicational Skills</li>
              <li>Problem Solving</li>
